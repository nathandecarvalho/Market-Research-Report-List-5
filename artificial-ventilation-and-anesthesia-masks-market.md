<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Ventilation and Anesthesia Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilation</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial ventilation and anesthesia masks market is segmented into invasive and non-invasive ventilation types. Invasive ventilation involves techniques that require intubation, where a tube is inserted into the airway to assist or control breathing, commonly used in critical care settings. Non-invasive ventilation, on the other hand, employs external devices like masks to deliver air or oxygen without airway insertion, making it suitable for patients with respiratory distress or those in need of support without the risks associated with intubation.</p></p>
