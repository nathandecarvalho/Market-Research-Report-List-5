<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Torque Limiter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Friction Plate</li><li>Magnetic Particle</li><li>Magnetic Hysteresis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The torque limiter market comprises three key types: friction plate, magnetic particle, and magnetic hysteresis. </p><p>Friction plate limiters utilize brake pads to slip and disengage, preventing excessive torque transmission. Magnetic particle limiters, on the other hand, employ a controlled magnetic field to transfer torque while allowing slippage under overload conditions. Magnetic hysteresis limiters use a magnetic field to create resistance, providing torque control with minimal wear. Each type serves to protect machinery by preventing damage from excessive torque, catering to various industrial applications.</p></p>
