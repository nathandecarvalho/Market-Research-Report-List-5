<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Insulin Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normal Pump</li><li>Patch Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Insulin pumps are devices used by people with diabetes to administer insulin in a controlled manner. Normal pumps are typically worn externally and deliver insulin via a tube connected to a cannula inserted under the skin. Patch pumps, on the other hand, are worn directly on the skin and deliver insulin through a small needle or cannula. While normal pumps offer more customization options, patch pumps are more discreet and convenient for daily use. Both types of pumps aim to provide users with a way to manage their blood sugar levels effectively.</p></p>
