<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tungsten CMP Slurry Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Tungsten Slurries</li><li>Non-Selective Tungsten Slurries</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Tungsten CMP (Chemical Mechanical Polishing) Slurry market is categorized into two main types: selective and non-selective tungsten slurries. Selective tungsten slurries are designed to effectively polish tungsten surfaces while minimizing the removal of other materials, making them ideal for advanced semiconductor applications. In contrast, non-selective tungsten slurries remove tungsten and surrounding materials uniformly, suitable for general applications where precise material control is less critical. Both types serve distinct purposes in semiconductor fabrication, influencing performance and yield.</p></p>
