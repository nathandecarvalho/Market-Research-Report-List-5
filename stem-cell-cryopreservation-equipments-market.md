<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Cryopreservation Equipments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Phase</li><li>Vapor Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stem cell cryopreservation equipment market is primarily divided into two types: liquid phase and vapor phase systems. Liquid phase cryopreservation involves directly storing biological samples in liquid nitrogen at ultra-low temperatures, providing stable and consistent conditions, making it ideal for long-term storage. In contrast, vapor phase cryopreservation utilizes nitrogen vapor to maintain samples at lower temperatures without direct contact with liquid nitrogen, reducing risks of contamination and improving safety. Both methods are essential for preserving stem cell viability.</p></p>
