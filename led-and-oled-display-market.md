<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED and OLED Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive-matrix</li><li>Active-matrix</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LED and OLED display market can be classified into two main types based on their matrix technology: passive-matrix and active-matrix displays. Passive-matrix displays use a grid of wires to control pixels, resulting in slower response times and lower image quality, making them suitable for simple applications. In contrast, active-matrix displays, such as AMOLED, use individual transistors for each pixel, allowing for faster refresh rates, better color accuracy, and higher resolutions, which are ideal for smartphones and high-end screens.</p></p>
