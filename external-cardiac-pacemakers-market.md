<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The External Cardiac Pacemakers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Chamber Pacemakers</li><li>Dual Chamber Pacemakers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The external cardiac pacemaker market consists of two primary types: single chamber and dual chamber pacemakers. Single chamber pacemakers stimulate either the right atrium or the right ventricle, offering simplicity and effectiveness for specific arrhythmias. In contrast, dual chamber pacemakers provide stimulation to both the atrium and ventricle, facilitating coordinated heartbeats and improving hemodynamic performance. This differentiation allows customization of treatment based on patient needs, driving growth in the pacemaker market as the demand for tailored cardiac care increases.</p></p>
