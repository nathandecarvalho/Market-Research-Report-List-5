<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glycoprotein Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N-linkage</li><li>O-linkage</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Glycoproteins are proteins that contain carbohydrates attached to them. There are three main types of glycosylation: N-linkage, O-linkage, and others. N-linkage involves attachment of sugars to the nitrogen atom of asparagine residues in the protein. O-linkage involves attachment of sugars to the oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in the protein. Other types of glycosylation include C-linkage and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. Each type of glycosylation plays a unique role in protein structure, function, and stability in the market.</p></p>
