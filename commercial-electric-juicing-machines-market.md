<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Electric Juicing Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Masticating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial electric juicing machines market is primarily divided into two types: centrifugal and masticating juicers. Centrifugal juicers operate at high speeds, using a spinning basket to extract juice, making them ideal for quick processing but often leading to foaming and oxidation. Masticating juicers, on the other hand, use a slow, grinding motion to extract juice, preserving nutrients and minimizing oxidation, which results in higher juice quality and yield. Both types cater to different consumer needs in the commercial sector.</p></p>
