<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small-Scale Liquefaction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Liquefaction</li><li>Indirect Liquefaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Direct liquefaction is a process in which coal is converted into liquid fuels without first gasifying it. This process involves breaking down coal into simpler molecules using heat and pressure, resulting in liquid fuel production. Indirect liquefaction, on the other hand, involves gasifying coal first and then converting the syngas produced into liquid fuels through processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Both direct and indirect liquefaction processes play a crucial role in the small-scale liquefaction market by providing alternative sources of liquid fuels.</p></p>
