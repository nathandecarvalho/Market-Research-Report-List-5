<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Heart Transplant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ventricular Assist Devices</li><li>Total Artificial Hearts</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The artificial heart transplant market encompasses various devices designed to support or replace cardiac function. Ventricular Assist Devices (VADs) are implanted to help one or both ventricles pump blood, often used as a bridge to transplant or for long-term therapy. Total Artificial Hearts (TAHs) replace both ventricles and are utilized when the heart cannot be salvaged. Other devices may include partial artificial hearts or combination therapies. Together, these innovations aim to improve patient outcomes and quality of life in severe heart failure cases.</p></p>
