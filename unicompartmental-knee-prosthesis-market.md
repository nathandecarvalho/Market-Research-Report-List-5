<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unicompartmental Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The unicompartmental knee prosthesis market encompasses two primary types: cemented and non-cemented bone prostheses. Cemented prostheses utilize a polymer-based adhesive to bond the implant securely to the bone, providing immediate stability and support, often favored in older populations. In contrast, non-cemented prostheses rely on a porous surface that allows bone ingrowth for long-term fixation, suitable for younger, more active patients. Both types are designed to restore joint function and alleviate pain while catering to different patient needs and preferences.</p></p>
