<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arbovirus Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Antibody Tests</li><li>Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The arbovirus testing market can be divided into two primary types: Antibody Tests and Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAAT). Antibody tests detect the presence of specific antibodies in a patient's blood, indicating past exposure or infection. In contrast, NAAT identifies the viral genetic material, providing real-time detection of current infections. Both testing methods are crucial for effective diagnosis, surveillance, and response to arboviral diseases, enhancing public health efforts and guiding treatment decisions.</p></p>
